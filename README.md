# web-development-foundations
Web Development Foundations is an intensive, 30-hour technical program designed to take students from curious browsers to confident builders. This course demystifies the "magic" behind the screen by breaking the web down into its three fundamental pillars: Structure (HTML5), Presentation (CSS3), and Behavior (JavaScript).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Construct accessible, SEO-friendly web pages using semantic HTML5 elements.
- Design responsive layouts that adapt to any screen size using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries.
- Program dynamic user interfaces by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) with JavaScript.
- Implement version control workflows using Git and GitHub for collaborative development.
- Debug front-end code efficiently using Browser Developer Tools.
- Deploy live websites to the cloud using modern platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
- Apply web security best practices (e.g., input validation, HTTPS) to protect user data.
