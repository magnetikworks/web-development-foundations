# Instructor Guide: Session 06 - Asynchronous JS

## Hour 1: Review & Theory
- **Assignment 2 Check:** Ensure students understand that their "Filter" logic is the exact same logic they will use for "Search" in real apps.
- **Analogy:** Use the "Restaurant Analogy" for Async—the waiter doesn't stand at the table waiting for the food to cook; they take other orders (Event Loop).

## Hour 2: Fetch & JSON
- **JSON:** Show a raw JSON file in the browser. Explain it's just a giant string that JS turns into an Object.
- **The Fetch Pattern:** Demonstrate the two-step process: (1) Get the Response, (2) Parse the JSON.

## Hour 3: Async/Await & Error Handling
- **Transition:** Show how much "cleaner" Async/Await looks compared to `.then()` chains.
- **Lab:** Provide the URL `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`. Let them replace their hardcoded array with this live data.

## OQF Checklist
- **Methodology:** Can students handle asynchronous data flow?
- **Professional Capacity:** Are they using `try/catch` to prevent app crashes?
