# 01 Web Fundamentals and Setup

## Development Tools:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) The industry standard IDE for web development. It's lightweight and has the best ecosystem for web foundations.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) Chrome’s DevTools are the baseline for most tutorials and have superior accessibility inspection tools.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Essential for tracking code changes. (Note: Mac users often have this via Xcode, but a fresh install is recommended).
- [Node.Js Runtime](https://nodejs.org/) Needed for installing linters and build tools

## VS Code Extensions
- Live Server: Launches a local development server with a live reload feature (see changes as soon as you save).
- Prettier - Code Formatter: Automatically cleans up code indentation and styling.
- Auto Close Tag / Auto Rename Tag: Saves time by managing HTML tags automatically.
- ESLint: Points out JavaScript errors in real-time before the code is even run.
- Thunder Client: Optional extension to be able to test API responses outside of the browser.

## Accounts
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) For hosting code repositories
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) These allow students to turn their code into a live URL for free.
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) Great for quick "scratchpad" coding during class exercises without creating full files.
