# Session 09 - The Lab & The Looming Deadline

## Hour 1: Sorting the "Red" Tickets
- **Identify the Strugglers:** Who hasn't deployed to Vercel yet? Priority #1 is getting a live URL for everyone.
- **Tip:** If someone is stuck on the GitHub API, have them use their local `myProjects` array from Assignment 2 as a fallback so they don't finish with an empty site.

## Hour 2: The Senior Dev Review
- **Don't code for them:** Ask questions. "Why did you use `innerHTML` here? What happens if the API fails?"
- **Encourage Peer Help:** If a student finishes early, designate them as a "Teaching Assistant" for the hour.

## Hour 3: The Final Polish
- **UI Audit:** Check for broken images, placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum), and console errors.
- **The "Pitch":** Tell them: "Session 10 is your demo. Practice explaining your code as if I'm a hiring manager."

## Session 09 "Exit Ticket"
Students shouldn't leave until they can show:
1. At least 8 meaningful GitHub commits.
2. A live URL that isn't throwing a 404 error.
3. At least one successful `fetch()` implementation.
