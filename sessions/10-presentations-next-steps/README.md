# Session 10 - Graduation

## The Demo Phase
- **Timekeeping:** With 5-7 mins per student, be strict with the timer to ensure everyone gets their moment.
- **The "Code Deep Dive":** Ask each student one technical question (e.g., "How did you handle the error if the API failed?").

## The Feedback Loop
- **Celebrate the Issues:** Praise the students who have a messy but well-documented Issue board. It shows they actually struggled and solved problems.
- **Vercel Pride:** Make sure every student leaves with their "Live Link" shared in the class chat/discord.

## The Future Roadmap
- **React Connection:** Show a quick "Hello World" in React. Point out how similar it looks to the Template Literals they just wrote. 
- **The "Stay Curious" Pitch:** Remind them that a Senior Developer is just a Junior who never stopped Googling.
