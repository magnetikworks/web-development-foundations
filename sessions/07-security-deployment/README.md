# Instructor Guide: Session 07 - Security & Deployment

## Hour 1: Security Mindset
- **Key Concept:** "Never trust user input." 
- **Demo:** Show a simple script tag injected into an input field to demonstrate how an XSS attack happens if using `.innerHTML`.
- **Discussion:** Ask students why they think some sites feel "slow" (large images, too many scripts).

## Hour 2: The Hosting Landscape
- **Netlify vs. Vercel:** Both are industry leaders. Vercel is great for Next.js; Netlify is excellent for static sites.
- **Demo:** Perform a "Drag and Drop" deploy on Netlify first, THEN show the "GitHub Integrated" deploy to show the power of automation.

## Hour 3: Professional Workflow
- **The "Final Project" Tease:** Explain that the next session is the Final Project Build. Their deployment today is the "dry run" for their final submission.
