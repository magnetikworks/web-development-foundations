# Session 08 - The Professional Sprint

## Hour 1: Planning & Governance
- **The "No-Code" Rule:** Enforce the first 30 mins as planning. If they start coding without Issues, they miss the "Professional Capacity" OQF requirement.
- **Activity:** Walk around and ensure Issue titles are actionable (e.g., "Implement API Fetch" vs "Do JS").

## Hour 2: Structural Integrity
- **Deployment First:** Ensure Vercel is linked early. This prevents "Deployment Panic" in the final hour.
- **Dry (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Watch for students copy-pasting 500 lines of CSS into 3 files. Encourage a single `style.css`.

## Hour 3: Data & Logic
- **The API Challenge:** Some students will have empty GitHub profiles. Suggest they use a local `projects.json` if they don't have enough repos yet.
- **Security Check:** Remind them to use `.textContent` for user-generated feedback to prevent XSS.

## OQF Standard Tracking
- **Autonomy:** Students are managing their own tickets.
- **Methodology:** Use of GitHub Issues and Vercel CD pipelines.

## OQF Standard Check
- **Autonomy:** Can the student break a large project into small, manageable tasks?
- **Professional Capacity:** Are they using industry-standard tools (Issues/Labels) to track progress?
