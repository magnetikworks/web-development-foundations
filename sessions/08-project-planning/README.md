# GitHub Issues & Project Management

## The "Sprint Start" (15 Minutes)
- **Concept:** Explain that in a company, you don't just "code"; you solve "tickets."
- **Activity:** Students must translate the Project Brief into specific GitHub Issues.
- **Example Issues:**
  - `feat: Setup 3-page HTML shell and shared CSS variables`
  - `feat: Implement GitHub API fetch for projects gallery`
  - `ui: Create responsive navigation with hamburger menu`
  - `docs: Write technical README and deployment instructions`

## The Workflow (During the Build)
- **The "Atomic" Commit:** Encourage students to commit every time they finish one issue.
- **The Magic Keyword:** Show them how to use `Fixes #1` in their commit message. This connects their code history to their project management.

## OQF Standard Check
- **Autonomy:** Can the student break a large project into small, manageable tasks?
- **Professional Capacity:** Are they using industry-standard tools (Issues/Labels) to track progress?
