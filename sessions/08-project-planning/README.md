# Instructor Guide: Session 08 - The Portfolio Launchpad

## Hour 1: Design & Intent
- **The Challenge:** Ask students, "If a recruiter has 10 seconds, what do they see?"
- **Activity:** 20 mins of sketching. No computers. This forces them to think about layout without asking AI for code first.
- **Requirement:** Each student must have a unique "Dynamic Twist" (e.g., a weather widget based on their location via Geolocation API).

## Hour 2: The Core Architecture
- **Multi-page Strategy:** Teach them how to keep the `nav` consistent across `index.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html`.
- **The Data Bridge:** Help them set up the `fetch()` call to `https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME/repos`. This is the ultimate proof of their Session 06 knowledge.

## Hour 3: Interactivity & Debugging
- **Focus:** Logic over styling. "Make it work, then make it pretty."
- **Check-in:** Ensure every student has successfully initialized a Git repo. 
- **The Deployment:** Goal for today is to have a "Coming Soon" page live on Netlify/Vercel.
