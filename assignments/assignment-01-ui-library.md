# Assignment 1: The UI Component Library
## Web Development Foundations
1. Goal
To build the core structural and visual components of a modern website using Semantic HTML5 and Responsive CSS. These components are the "puzzle pieces" that will form the foundation of your final Portfolio Project.
2. Requirements
You are required to build three distinct components in a single index.html file, styled by an external style.css.
    1. Responsive Navigation Bar (Flexbox)
Structure: Use the <nav> element containing a logo (text or image) and an unordered list of 4 links.
Behavior: Use Flexbox to space the logo and links. Ensure the layout remains functional on mobile screens (links should stack or wrap).
Interaction: Add a :hover state to links to improve user experience.

    2. Feature/Project Card (CSS Grid)
Structure: Create a card using the <article> tag. It must include an image, a category badge (e.g., "Web Design"), a title, a short description, and a "View Project" button.
Layout: Use CSS Grid for the card's internal layout (e.g., placing the badge over the image or aligning the button at the bottom).
Styling: Implement a subtle box-shadow and a transition effect when the card is hovered.

    3. Accessible Contact Form
Structure: Include fields for Name, Email, Subject (Dropdown), and Message (Textarea).
Accessibility: Every input must have a matching <label> with a correct for attribute. Use the required attribute where appropriate.
Focus States: Style the :focus state of inputs so users navigating via keyboard can see which field is active.

3. Evaluation Criteria
Semantics: Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<form>`.
Layout Logic: Correct implementation of Flexbox and Grid properties.
Responsiveness: Elements should not "break" or overlap when the browser window is resized.
Code Quality: Use of meaningful class names (e.g., .nav-link instead of .blue-text).
Deployment: * Students will push their code to a GitHub Repository.
