# Final Project: The Professional Developer Portfolio
## 1. Project Overview
   The capstone of this course is the creation, optimization, and deployment of your Professional Developer Portfolio. This multi-page responsive website will showcase your technical skills, the projects you've built (including your assignments), and provide a way for potential employers or clients to contact you.

## 2. Technical Requirements
Your project must include:

    1. Structure & Design (The HTML/CSS Pillar)
     - Multi-Page Layout: At least three distinct pages (e.g., Home, Projects, About/Contact).
     - Global Navigation: A consistent, responsive navbar across all pages (refined from Assignment 1).
     - Responsive Grid: A project gallery that adjusts its columns based on screen size (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
     - Custom Styling: A cohesive color palette and typography system (no default browser styles).

    2. Interactivity & Data (The JavaScript Pillar)
     - Dynamic Gallery: Projects must be rendered from a data source (refined from Assignment 2).
     - Asynchronous Integration: At least one component must use fetch() to pull data (e.g., displaying your GitHub repositories or weather data).
     - Form Validation: The contact form must validate user input (e.g., checking for valid email formats) before "submission."

    3. Deployment & Workflow (The Professional Pillar)
     - Version Control: A clean GitHub repository with a minimum of 10 meaningful commits.
     - Documentation: A README.md file explaining the project, technologies used, and how to run it locally.
     - Live Hosting: Successful deployment to Vercel with a custom (or Vercel-provided) live URL.

## 3. Deployment Steps
One of our core goals is "shipping" your code. Choose any of these one options to deploy your code.
