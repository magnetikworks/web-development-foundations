# Final Project: The Professional Developer Portfolio
## 1. Project Overview
   The capstone of this course is the creation, optimization, and deployment of your Professional Developer Portfolio. This multi-page responsive website will showcase your technical skills, the projects you've built (including your assignments), and provide a way for potential employers or clients to contact you.

## 2. Technical Requirements
Your project must include:

    1. Structure & Design (The HTML/CSS Pillar)
     - Multi-Page Layout: At least three distinct pages (e.g., Home, Projects, About/Contact).
     - Global Navigation: A consistent, responsive navbar across all pages (refined from Assignment 1).
     - Responsive Grid: A project gallery that adjusts its columns based on screen size (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).
     - Custom Styling: A cohesive color palette and typography system (no default browser styles).

    2. Interactivity & Data (The JavaScript Pillar)
     - Dynamic Gallery: Projects must be rendered from a data source (refined from Assignment 2).
     - Asynchronous Integration: At least one component must use fetch() to pull data (e.g., displaying your GitHub repositories or weather data).
     - Form Validation: The contact form must validate user input (e.g., checking for valid email formats) before "submission."

    3. Deployment & Workflow (The Professional Pillar)
     - Version Control: A clean GitHub repository with a minimum of 10 meaningful commits.
     - Documentation: A README.md file explaining the project, technologies used, and how to run it locally.
     - Live Hosting: Successful deployment to Vercel with a custom (or Vercel-provided) live URL.

## 3. . Vercel Deployment Steps
One of our core goals is "shipping" your code. Follow these steps in Session 7:

    1. Prepare: Ensure your main entry point is named index.html at the root of your project.
    2. Push: Commit and push all final changes to your GitHub repository.
    3. Connect: Log into Vercel using your GitHub account.
    4. Import: Click "Add New Project" and select your portfolio repository.
    5. Deploy: Click "Deploy." Vercel will provide a URL (e.g., my-portfolio.vercel.app).
    6. Continuous Integration: Make a small change to your CSS, push to GitHub, and watch Vercel automatically update your live site.
